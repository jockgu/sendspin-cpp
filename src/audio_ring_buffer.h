/**
 * @brief Pre-allocated SPSC ring buffer for zero-copy encoded audio chunk transfer between
 * the network thread and sync task
 *
 * Each entry stores an AudioRingBufferEntry header followed immediately by the variable-
 * length audio payload. All storage is pre-allocated at construction; there are no per-
 * chunk heap allocations. The SPSC contract is: one producer (WebSocket callback thread)
 * calls write_chunk(), and one consumer (sync task) calls receive_chunk() / return_chunk().
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Call create() to allocate and initialize the ring buffer
 * 2. Producer calls write_chunk() to insert encoded audio chunks
 * 3. Consumer calls receive_chunk() to obtain a pointer to the next entry
 * 4. Consumer processes the entry, then calls return_chunk() to release it
 * 5. Call reset() to drain all items when stopping the consumer task
 *
 * @code
 * auto buf = SendspinAudioRingBuffer::create(512 * 1024);
 *
 * // Producer thread:
 * buf->write_chunk(data, size, timestamp, CHUNK_TYPE_ENCODED_AUDIO, 100);
 *
 * // Consumer thread:
 * AudioRingBufferEntry* entry = buf->receive_chunk(UINT32_MAX);
 * if (entry) {
 *     process(entry->data(), entry->data_size);
 *     buf->return_chunk(entry);
 * }
 * @endcode
